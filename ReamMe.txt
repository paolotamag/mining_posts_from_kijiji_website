the screenshot shows multiple queries over really few documents

my project has 3 files: Collect.py, Index.py and Search.py


please place all of them in the same of folder and follow the instructions
what to do on command line:

1)	python Collect.py

2)	select how many pages (starting from the first one) you want to 
	download from: 
  	'http://www.kijiji.it/case/vendita/roma-annunci-roma/'
	you cannot download more than 1999 pages
	just type the number of the last page that you want
	and it will download every page from #1 until that one
	
3)	wait until it's done. 
	it will create all the documents in the folder 'documents'

4)	python Index.py

5)	select the number of files you want to load from the folder 'documents'
	it will start from the first one until the number you have chosen
	to do that just type the number of the last document you want

6)	wait him to create the files 'vocabulary.txt' and 'index.txt' in the folder 'index'
	(I attached to the email also those same files computed over all the ads (almost 64k))
	(if they were in the same folder index before this step it should override them)

7)	python Search.py

8)	type in your query and press enter

9)	if the query doesn't give any result it will say: 'Your search - <WHAT YOU JUST TYPED> - did not match any documents.'
	
10)	it will display the results as agreed and tell you the number of found ads in the end

please let me know for any incomprehension
